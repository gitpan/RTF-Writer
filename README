NAME
     RTF::Writer - for generating documents in Rich Text Format

SYNOPSIS
       use RTF::Writer;
       my $rtf = RTF::Writer->new_to_file("greetings.rtf");
       $rtf->prolog( 'title' => "Greetings, hyoomon" );
       $rtf->number_pages;
       $rtf->paragraph(
         \'\fs40\b\i',  # 20pt, bold, italic
         "Hi there!"
       );
       $rtf->close;

DESCRIPTION
     This module is for generating documents in Rich Text Format.

     This module is a class; an object belonging to this class
     acts like an output filehandle, and calling methods on it
     causes RTF text to be written.

     Incidentally, this module also exports a few useful
     functions, upon request.

     The following documentation assumes some familiarity with
     the RTF Specification.  Users not already intimately
     familiar with RTF should look at RTF::Cookbook.

[... RTF::Cookbook is included in this dist ...]

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires perl 5.005 to run.  If you really need to run it
under perl 5.004, email me and I'll suggest how to get it to work.


INSTALLATION

You install Pod::HTML2Pod, as you would install any Perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of RTF::Writer in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

See perldoc perlmodinstall for more information.


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in RTF/Writer.pod and
RTF/Cookbook.pod.  POD is readable with the 'perldoc' utility.  See
ChangeLog for recent changes.


MACPERL INSTALLATION NOTES

Don't bother with the makefiles.  Just move the RTF directory
itno your MacPerl site_lib or lib directory.
